Despite initial nerves, Gibson quickly felt at ease thanks to Joe’s patience and ability to adapt conversation levels to his proficiency. Joe encourages Gibson to use his existing vocabulary and provides immediate feedback, including a rewriting process that truly reinforces learning. After 10+ lessons, Gibson is much more confident, even taking the initiative to share personal stories in English. I highly recommend Joe."</p>

Joe is a very dedicated and thoughtful teacher who always corrects my mistakes and helps me improve. My listening and speaking used to be my weak points, but now I can even understand English without subtitles. As a mother of a three-year-old, being able to take classes after 11 p.m. Taiwan time is very important to me, and Joe's flexible schedule makes this possible. Before an overseas business trip, he even gave me intensive practice on commonly used meeting expressions, which was incredibly helpful. If you're looking for a professional teacher whose methods actually bridge the gap between textbook learning and the real world, Joe is the one."</p>

He is incredibly generous with his time outside of class to help us practice our English. I especially enjoy his teaching style and his British accent.

I had the opportunity to have some classes with him where I felt confident because his methodology help me to feel confidence and comfortable and our classes it was like a good friend’s conversation because he’s a great sense of humor and helps in every aspect or detail that you want to say or transmit in your sentences.
