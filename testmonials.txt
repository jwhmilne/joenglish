I work in finance for a foreign company and use English regularly at work. Joe is a very dedicated and thoughtful teacher who always corrects my mistakes and helps me improve. My listening and speaking used to be my weak points, but now I can even understand English without subtitles.
As a mother of a three-year-old, being able to take classes after 11 p.m. Taiwan time is very important to me, and Joe’s flexible schedule makes this possible. Before an overseas business trip, he even gave me intensive practice on commonly used meeting expressions, which was incredibly helpful. If you’re looking for a professional teacher whose classes are effective and never boring, Joe is definitely the right choice!
